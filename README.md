## How to Play This Manual
For more information on how to play a Manual, visit the Archipelago Manual discord channel.

For this particular manual these are some things to keep in mind:
* If Death Link is enabled, you will have to increase doom every time someone sends you a death. If any of your investigators are defeated or devoured, you'll send a death link. If multiple investigators are defeated/decvoured at the same time, only send one death.
* You may change in the options if you want to do go against 3 or 6 Ancient Ones.
* These will be randomized into the multiworld; Investigators, Ancient Ones, Clues, Spells, Assets and Artifacts.
* When you obtain a card from the multiworld you put them in their respective deck. They are now in the pool of things you'll be able to obtain. The sames goes for clues, you put them in the Clue Pool.
* Speaking of Clues, if you allow an expansion with a sideboard, their respective clues will also be accessible. As such it will sometime be required to use said sideboards to progress through the run.
* You'll probably have to retry many times against an Ancient One before you're able to defeat it due to the nature of an Archipelago Run. Reminder, you need to defeat 3/6 in a row for the campaign to be considered completed. Good Luck!
